    "Data science used to be called data mining, and for good reasons. It is a dirty, soul-wrenching job in which many die. Machine learning is the only enjoyable part that has some mathematics to it, but whatever happens before you can deploy a learning algorithm is drudgery. The renaming of the subject was a PR move, and it is about as pretentious as calling coal mining carbon extraction science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will focus on the drudgery part, which is inevitable if you want to obtain any non-trivial result with machine learning. My hope is that the topics covered today translate to other workloads you might encounter in your daily work. The topics will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I/O operations, which includes pulling files off the Internet and elementary loading/saving. We will not work on scale, as the IT policy explicitly bans this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lots of text processing. This alone is a compelling reason to use Python 3: you will avoid most of the problems associated with the rabbit hole known as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). You'd also better make friends with [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database-like operations, dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual inspection of data to get a feeling of it.\n",

    "The modules we import reflect the above: numpy or TensorFlow does not have a place here. We will scrape stuff from arXiv to analyze correlation patterns between authors, metadata, and Impact Factor. There are high-level libraries to do scraping (e.g. [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)) and also to work with arXiv (e.g.[arxiv.py](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv.py)), but here we will build things bottom-up, so we import low-level I/O, networking, and text processing and parsing libraries."
